Introduction
============

Store data in an easy to use, single class NodeTree structure.

It supports various tree operations such as:

- separating and combining trees
- degenerating a branch (pruning all branches between a and b)
- traversing the nodes in-order or post-order

I have used it in several projects where I needed storage of iterative simulation data.

It is currently being reimplemented to there is a lot of missing functionality.
