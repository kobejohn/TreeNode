Introduction
============

Store data in an easy to use, single class NodeTree structure.

It supports various tree operations such as:

- separating and combining trees (automatically avoids creating cycles)
- traversing the nodes in-order or post-order
- access up or down through doubly-linked parent/child


I have used it in several projects where I needed storage of iterative simulation data.

It is currently being reimplemented to there is a lot of missing functionality.
