Introduction
============

Store data in an easy to use, single class NodeTree structure.

It supports various tree operations such as:

- separating / combining trees very easily
- degenerating a branch (pruning all branches between a and b)
- searching the tree for specific values in the data items

I have used it in several projects where I needed storage of iterative simulation data.

It is currently being reimplemented to there is a lot of missing functionality.
